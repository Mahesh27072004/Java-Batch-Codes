//the question arise is why we do upcasting in this scenrio?
        
        // the answer is, if we don't do upcasting then if the service provider who is implementing the abstract class with implementation logic 
        // can add its own different methods which are not in the requirement or in the blueprint of the abstract(designed by service specifier) class 
        // so to avoid this if we do upcasting even if the service provider can define any its own different methods, but it wont be accessed at the compile time 
        // as the refernce of the object is upcasted to the superclass type so compiler will not do the binding to newly declared methods by the service provider.
